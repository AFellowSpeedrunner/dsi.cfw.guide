::: danger

**Installing or uninstalling Unlaunch may randomly brick your console! You have been warned!**

:::

**WARNING:** An uninstall of Unlaunch may brick your Nintendo DSi. Here are some cases on why you may want to uninstall Unlaunch but with solutions that don't require uninstalling.

- **The Unlaunch Background is scary:** <router-link to="installing-unlaunch">Reinstall Unlaunch</router-link> using the new instructions. They now contain instructions on how to change the background
- **I'm having an issue with Unlaunch or my console after installing it:** The <router-link to="troubleshooting.html#unlaunch">Troubleshooting</router-link> page will explain how to fix many issues you may have

::: warning

To reduce the chances of bricking, make sure that you have not installed any illegitimate DSiWare to your NAND backup (the SDNAND redirection provided by hiyaCFW does not count), or have otherwise tampered with system files.

::: warning

When uninstalling Unlaunch, you should **NOT** use its built-in uninstaller, because there is a chance that it will brick the console. Please see below for information on uninstalling it properly.

Once you have reviewed the above information, proceed to <router-link to="restoring-nand">Restoring a NAND Backup</router-link>. This will guide you through flashing the NAND backup you made during <router-link to="dumping-nand">Dumping NAND</router-link>.
- If you are no longer in possession of a NAND backup from before you installed Unlaunch, follow <router-link to="dumping-nand">Dumping NAND</router-link> and proceed with <router-link to="restoring-nand">Restoring a NAND Backup</router-link>. There are instructions for users who have Unlaunch installed on their NAND backup
