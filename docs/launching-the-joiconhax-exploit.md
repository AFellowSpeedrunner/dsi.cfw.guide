We'll start by first launching our exploit. JoiConhax was initially a meme created by the 3DS community, but it turns out it can actually be used to exploit a DSi.

Launching the exploit will boot you into TWiLight Menu++, a homebrew application that acts as a replacement to the DSi Menu.


## Requirements

- A set of Nintendo Switch Joy-cons
- A Windows 10 or later PC

## Launching the exploit

1. Ensure your SD card is inserted into your Nintendo DSi
1. Pair the Joy-cons to your computer
1. Place each Joy-con on each side of the console
1. A storage device will appear in your File Explorer
1. In the drive, place `BOOT.NDS` from the previous page on the root
1. Boot your Nintendo DSi
1. If the exploit was successful, your device wil have booted into TWiLight Menu++

::: warning

If the top screen turns green, you do not have TWiLight Menu++'s `BOOT.NDS` on the root of your SD card. Follow the [prep work](get-started.html#section-i-prep-work) again.

:::

You can now use **TW**i**L**ight Menu++! First, it will ask you to select your language and region. These do not need to match your console's language or region, so set them to whichever you prefer. Next, it's recommended to continue on and make a NAND backup. This can potentially be used to save your console if anything bad happens in the future.
