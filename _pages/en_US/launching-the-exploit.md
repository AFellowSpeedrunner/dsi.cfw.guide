{% include toc title="Instructions" %}

We'll start by first setting up your SD card to launch our exploit. For most users, we recommend using an exploit called "Memory Pit" which takes advantage of a flaw in how the Nintendo DSi Camera application handles image data.

Once we launch the exploit, it'll boot us into TWiLight Menu++, a homebrew application that acts as a replacement to the DSi Menu.

## Requirements
- A way to copy downloaded files to your SD card
- An application that can extract archives, such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)

## Section I - SD Card Setup
Ensure your SD card is [formatted correctly](sd-prep).
{: .notice--warning}

The source code is not needed. You only need the actual files.
{: .notice--info}

Using a Windows, Linux or macOS device? We have a tool that will automatically set up your SD card for following the guide.
{: .notice--info}

### Memory Pit
1. Download the Memory Pit binary corresponding to the version and region of your Nintendo DSi system
   - for versions [1.0 - 1.3 (USA, EUR, AUS, JPN)](https://github.com/emiyl/dsi.cfw.guide/raw/master/assets/files/memory_pit/256/pit.bin)
   - for versions [1.4 - 1.4.5 (USA, EUR, AUS, JPN)](https://github.com/emiyl/dsi.cfw.guide/raw/master/assets/files/memory_pit/768_1024/pit.bin)
   - all versions [(KOR, CHN)](https://github.com/emiyl/dsi.cfw.guide/raw/master/assets/files/memory_pit/256/pit.bin)
1. Make sure the following path exists on your SD card: `sd:/private/ds/app/484E494A/`
   - You will already have this directory if you have previously copied photos to your SD card via the Nintendo DSi Camera application. If so, you do not need to delete it and recreate it.
   - If it does not exist, please create the individual folders
1. If there is already a `pit.bin` file in that path, create a backup of that file
1. Place the Memory Pit `.bin` file in this folder

For an understanding on why we're doing this, please review the [FAQ](/faq#what-functionality-would-i-lose-by-modding-my-system).

### TWiLight Menu++
1. Download the latest DSi version of [TWiLight Menu++](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases).
1. Extract the contents of the `.7z` archive anywhere on your device
1. Place the extracted `_nds` folder on the root of your SD card
1. Place the extracted `boot.nds` file on the root of your SD card

## Section II - Launching the exploit

1. Ensure your SD card is inserted into your Nintendo DSi
1. Boot your Nintendo DSi and launch the Nintendo DSi Camera application
   - If the camera on your Nintendo DSi doesn't work, you can still use Memory Pit as long as the tutorial does not appear. If the tutorial appears and a crash is shown as you try to complete it, please use an [alternate exploit](alternate-exploits)
1. Select the SD Card icon on the top right
   - If you receive a message saying your SD card isn't inserted, please use another SD card
   - If you receive a message saying that your SD card cannot be used, ensure your SD card is formatted correctly
1. Select your SD card's camera album
   - The screen should flash magenta if Memory Pit was copied correctly

If your Nintendo DSi flashes magenta but the top screen turns green while the bottom is white, then you do not have `BOOT.NDS` on the root of your SD card.
{: .notice--warning}

You should now be looking at the Nintendo DSi Splash Screen, which is being handled by TWiLight Menu++.

## Section III - Configuring TWiLight Menu++

1. Once you're in TWiLight Menu++, press SELECT to switch to the DS Classic Menu
1. Tap the button at the very bottom to open settings
1. Use the <kbd>L</kbd> and <kbd>R</kbd> buttons to switch over to the "Misc. Settings" page
1. Switch the "SysNAND Region" entry to your console's region
1. Switch the "DSiWare Exploit" entry to Memory Pit
   - If you're using a different exploit, select that instead

Continue to [Dumping NAND](dumping-nand)
