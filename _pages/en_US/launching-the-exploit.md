We'll start by first setting up your SD card to launch our exploit. For most users, we recommend using an exploit called "Memory Pit" which takes advantage of a flaw in how the DSi Camera handles data.

Once we launch the exploit, it'll boot us into TWiLight Menu++, a homebrew application that acts as a replacement to the DSi Menu.

## Section I - SD Card Setup
Ensure your SD card is [formatted correctly](sd-prep).
{: .notice--warning}

The source code is not needed. You only need the actual files.
{: .notice--info}

### Requirements
 - An SD card for your DSi
 - A way to copy downloaded files to your SD card
 - An application that can extract archives, such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)

### Memory Pit
1. Download the Memory Pit binary corresponding to the version and region of your Nintendo DSi system
  - for versions [1.0 - 1.3 (USA, EUR, AUS, JPN)](https://github.com/emiyl/dsi.cfw.guide/raw/master/assets/files/memory_pit/256/pit.bin)
  - for versions [1.4 - 1.4.5 (USA, EUR, AUS, JPN)](https://github.com/emiyl/dsi.cfw.guide/raw/master/assets/files/memory_pit/768_1024/pit.bin)
  - all versions [(KOR, CHN)](https://github.com/emiyl/dsi.cfw.guide/raw/master/assets/files/memory_pit/256/pit.bin)
1. Insert your DSi SD card into your computer
1. Navigate to `private/ds/app/484E494A/` folder on your SD card
  - If this folder does not exist, create it
1. Move the Memory Pit `.bin` file to this folder

### TWiLight Menu++
1. Download the latest release of [TWiLight Menu++](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases/latest)
1. Extract the `.7z` file to somewhere on your computer
1. Copy the `boot.nds` file and the `_nds` folder from the `DSi&3DS - SD card users` folder to the root of your SD card
1. Copy *the contents* of the `SDNAND root` folder in the `DSi - CFW users` folder to the root of your SD card
1. Copy the `_nds` folder to the root of your SD card
  - Replace files and merge folders, if asked

You may notice that there are two `_nds` folders. This is not a mistake. While the first one contains all the TWiLight Menu++ files, those are universal to flashcarts as well. The second `_nds` folder contains DSi/3DS specific files, such as the homebrew version of nds-boostrap.
{: .notice--info}

## Section II - Launching the exploit

1. Boot your Nintendo DSi and launch the DSi Camera application
  - If a camera tutorial appears, ensure your camera works. If it doesn't work, you will get a crash ("An error has occured") and would be unable to use Memory Pit
  - If your camera is non-functional, please follow our [alternate exploits](alternate-exploits) guide
2. With your SD card inserted into your console, select the SD Card icon on the top right
 - If you receive a message saying your SD card isn't inserted, please use another SD card
 - If you receive a message saying that your SD card cannot be used, ensure your SD card is formatted correctly.
3. Select your SD card's camera album
 - If you copied Memory Pit correctly, your screen should flash magenta

The top screen should now boot into TWiLight Menu++.

If your Nintendo DSi flashes magenta but the top screen turns green while the bottom is white, then you do not have `BOOT.NDS` on the root of your SD card.
{: .notice--warning}

You have now configured your entry point to launch TWiLight Menu++, an open-source homebrew application that can act as a replacement to the Nintendo DSi System Menu.

It provides a customizable unified interface for navigating your DSi SD card to launch a variety of titles, including Nintendo DS and Gameboy Advance.

## Section III - Configuring TWiLightMenu++

1. Once you're in TWiLightMenu++, press **(SELECT)** to switch to the DS Classic Menu
1. Tap the button at the very bottom to open settings
1. Use the **(L)** and **(R)** buttons to switch over to the "Misc. Settings" page
1. Switch the "DSiWare Exploit" entry to Memory Pit
  - If you're using a different exploit, select that instead

Continue to [Dumping NAND](dumping-nand)

## TWiLightMenu++ Usage

{% capture usageInstructions %}
- TWiLight Menu++ is an SD card navigator. You can launch the available applications anywhere on the SD card
- If files don't appear, they are most likely hidden by the filesystem. You can check via Windows or MacOS
   - You can view hidden files on TWiLight Menu++ by enabling the option in the TWiLight Menu++ Settings Application
   - Regardless of the settings, the `_nds` folder will always be hidden in TWiLight Menu++
- To launch GBA applications, you'll need a Gameboy Advance `bios.bin` file. This can be located either on the root of your SD card, a `gba` folder or a `_gba` folder
  - There are three ways you can dump a BIOS: Through [a modded non-family edition Wii/GameCube with a link cable](https://github.com/FIX94/gba-link-cable-dumper), [GBA/DS (Phat + Lite) with a GBA Flashcard](https://glazedbelmont.github.io/gbabiosdump/#gameboy-advance-sp-micro-ds-ds-lite) or a [modded 3DS using most Virtual Console Titles](https://glazedbelmont.github.io/gbabiosdump/#virtual-console-title-from-a-3ds) (can't be GBA or non-nintendo)
- You can set TWiLight Menu++ to autolaunch when you power on your DSi, if you have Unlaunch installed
  - This is shown later in the guide
