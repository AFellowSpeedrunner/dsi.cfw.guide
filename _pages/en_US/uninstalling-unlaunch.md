---

**Installing or uninstalling Unlaunch may randomly brick your console! You have been warned!**
{:.notice--danger}

This may **result in a brick** if you have installed any non-legit DSiWare to your System NAND (not the SDNAND redirection provided by hiyaCFW), or have otherwise tampered with system files.
{: .notice--warning}

1. Download the latest version of [Unlaunch](https://problemkaputt.de/unlaunch.zip)
2. Extract `UNLAUNCH.DSI` from the Unlaunch archive and copy it anywhere your SD card
3. Hold **(A)** + **(B)** on system boot
4. Select the `UNLAUNCH.DSI` file you had just downloaded
5. Select `Uninstall`
  - It will say that the system will become "useless", which is NoCash's way of saying stock aka back to normal
6. When completed, reboot (power down and power back on) your system in order to verify Unlaunch uninstalled properly
