{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

If you are introduced to a tutorial when launching the Nintendo DSi Camera application and get a crash when attempting to complete it, you cannot use Memory Pit. Here are other exploits you could use instead

Ensure you have set up [TWiLight Menu++](launching-the-exploit#twilight-menu) on your SD card before proceeding
{: .notice-info}

Any of the below exploits should only be used as necessary. Try to use [Memory Pit](launching-the-exploit) when possible
{: .notice-info}

{% capture otherinstructions %}
If you're on an older firmware, you have access to save game exploits for a select [list of games](https://dsibrew.org/wiki/DSi_exploits#DSiWare(True_DSi-Mode)_Exploits).

These will not be covered here as they are largely obsolete. Only use this as a last resort, if both Memory Pit and Flipnote Lenny aren't working for you.

petit-compwner will not be usable as it requires a working camera to launch the exploit.
