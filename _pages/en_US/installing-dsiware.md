This guide will "install" the DSiWare to your DSi, for use with DSiMenu++.
Using DSiMenu++ has several advantages, but the largest of them is that TMD and ARGV files do not need to be generated.

## Instructions
1. Open the dumped folder on your PC containing your DSiWare
2. Navigate to `content`
3. Rename the `.app` file to have a `.nds` extension
4. Make a directory in your SD card's `roms` folder called `dsiware` if it doesn't already exist
5. Move your DSiWare `.nds` file to the `roms/dsiware` folder on your SD card
6. Power on your DSi, open DSiMenu++, and navigate to `roms > dsiware`
  - Your new DSiWare will appear
